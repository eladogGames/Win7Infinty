## Apps

* Google Chrome

* FireFox

* Microsoft Edge

* VxKex [link]
Q: why VxKex with link?

A: It's linked because Windows Defender think it's a virus but it not ture at all,
it's let you run windows 10+ apps

## Download 

### (windows 7 have to be installed)

There is 3 Folders

* #### Desktop 
u need to copy all the files inside the Desktop Folder to the Desktop Folder (i so smart)

(if you have a working browser & VxKex you dont need to copy this folder)


* #### Windows

U need copy the Windows folder into C:\ (CHECKED IN VIRTUAL MACHINE IT'S SAFE)

* #### Appdata
U need to copy the folder in your user folder (This Folder is already exists
but it's invisible)

## NOTE
This Checked on virtual machine (VMware)

maked the project in the Windows 7 VM
I make the custom theme in the windows folder (i know is was not a good idea the because that not SMART, because that i used VM)
